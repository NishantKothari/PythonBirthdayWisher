This Code includes the functionality to wish someone on their birthday automatically on your behalf.

This code works on the excel sheet that contains the data as in the format given below

Sno   Name   Birthday  Year     Email
1     ABC    18-Jul    2019     abc@your_mail.com


Including this excel sheet will enable to execute the code automatically.
But will have to update the sheet regularly which requires manual Updation.

I would be very interested in collabs on this code any imporvements are welcomed.
