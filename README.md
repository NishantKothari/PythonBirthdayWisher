This Code includes the functionality to wish someone on their birthday automatically on your behalf.

This code works on the excel sheet that contains the data as in the format given below

Screenshot of the Excel Sheet is Attached. Please add another column for number section to send whatsapp messages 
The format for adding the number should be '+countryCode' then 'phone number' eg. +911023456789

Including this excel sheet will enable to execute the code automatically.
But will have to update the sheet regularly which requires manual Updation.

I would be very interested in collabs on this code any imporvements are welcomed.
